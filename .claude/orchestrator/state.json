  "taskDescription": "Implement Tier 2: 18 production-ready AI providers with zero external dependencies (except stdlib, sqlite3, google/uuid). Replace all external SDKs with in-house HTTP client. Implement extended thinking for Anthropic and Gemini. Add JSON Schema validation framework. All providers must pass TDD requirements with 90%+ test coverage.\n\nPhase 1: Feature 0 - HTTP Foundation Layer\nBuild production-grade HTTP client infrastructure that all 18 providers will use. Zero external dependencies except Go stdlib. Includes connection pooling, retry with exponential backoff, rate limit parsing, timeout management, context propagation, logging hooks.\n\nPhase 2: 18 Provider Implementations\nAudio (5): ElevenLabs, Deepgram, OpenAI Whisper, OpenAI TTS, PlayHT\nVideo (2): Luma AI, Runway ML\nLLM (5): OpenAI (extend), Anthropic (extend), Google Gemini (extend), DeepSeek (extend), Cerebras (extend)\nImage (2): FAL (extend), Midjourney\nEmbeddings (3): OpenAI Embeddings (extend), Cohere Embeddings, Voyage AI\nReal-Time (1): OpenAI Realtime API (extend)\n\nEach provider must:\n- Implement providers.Provider interface\n- Use shared HTTP client from Feature 0\n- Have 90%+ test coverage (unit, integration, E2E)\n- Support rate limiting, cost tracking, streaming\n- Remove all external SDK dependencies\n- Pass go vet, gofmt, race detector\n\nTarget: Production-ready code with scientific validation through comprehensive testing.",
