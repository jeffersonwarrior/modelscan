- Pending: 8
- Failed: 0

## Task Description
Implement 18 AI provider SDKs with zero dependencies, 90%+ test coverage, and programmatic validation enforcement.

## Providers to Implement (Tier 2)
1. ElevenLabs TTS - text-to-speech with voice cloning
2. Deepgram STT - live streaming transcription
3. OpenAI Whisper - audio transcription extension
4. OpenAI TTS - text-to-speech extension
5. PlayHT - ultra-realistic TTS
6. Luma AI Video - Dream Machine video generation
7. Runway ML - Gen-2 video generation
8. OpenAI Extended - refactor to use internal HTTP client
9. Anthropic Extended Thinking - extended thinking mode
10. Google Gemini Thinking - thinking modes
11. DeepSeek Extended - refactor to use internal HTTP client
12. Cerebras Extended - refactor to use internal HTTP client
13. FAL Extended - refactor to use internal HTTP client
14. Midjourney - V6 text-to-image
15. OpenAI Embeddings - embeddings extension
16. Cohere Embeddings - embed-english-v3.0
17. Voyage AI - embeddings provider
18. OpenAI Realtime API - real-time voice conversation

## Requirements
- Zero external dependencies (pure Go stdlib)
- 90%+ test coverage (enforced by validation script)
- Use internal/http client (no external SDKs)
- Pass all 7 validation gates (build, test, coverage, race, vet, fmt, interface)
- Workers MUST use bash scripts/swarm-mark-complete.sh to mark complete
